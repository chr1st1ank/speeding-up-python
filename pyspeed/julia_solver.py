"""Solver using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) which has a comfortable binding for Python.

Prerequisites:
    * Install Julia itself and the python module PyJulia (with `pip install julia`)

Notes:
    * Julia has to be written in separate *.jl files, but they don't have to be compiled explicitly. Instead they are
      compile just-in-time when the functions are executed for the first time.
    * With the approach taken here (`julia.include(<filename>)`) only the last function of a *.jl file is imported.
      There is also an alternative `importall` method.
    * The code assumes that the standard "high-level" mode of PyJulia can be used, which needs Julia to be on the PATH
      variable. Alternative approaches are described on the [PyJulia page](https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia)
    * Julia seems to return numpy array instead of lists. This has to be taken care of.
