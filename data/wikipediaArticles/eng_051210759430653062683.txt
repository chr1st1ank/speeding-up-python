# Plagiarism and controversies 

There have been allegations of plagiarism against Gopi Chand Narang for copying and translating from secondary sources major portions of his Sahitya Akademi award-winning book Sakhtiyat, Pas-Sakhtiyat aur Mashriqui Sheriyat (Structuralism, Post-Structuralism and Eastern Poetics) but Narang has responded to it and now it has been proved that the allegations were baseless and a result of maligning campaign. Narang has scholarly exposed the Urdu modernism and claimed that it was an anti-liberal movement hence he was targeted by the propagators of Urdu modernism like CM Naim. Imran Shahid Bhinder and Prof. CM. Naim of Chicago University have provided textual evidence of plagiarism. There have also been allegations of corruption and controversial appointments under his Presidency of Sahitya Akademi, which he headed from 2003 to 2007.However, the fact is that the plagiarism charges have been countered in a recent article titled "How author and critic Gopi Chand Narang survived a maligning campaign". The same article, in fact, exposes both Imran Shahid and C.M.Naim that how and why they had carried out a negative campaign against Narang and how they failed. Similarly, in a recent interview, Narang has responded to allegations of corruption during his tenure as the President of the Sahitya Akademi. Narang has said that if he had done something wrong those who carried out false propaganda should have gone to the court. It was libelous and baseless allegations on the ground of personal animosity.
