## Julian Simmonds

Julian Graham John Simmonds (born 29 August 1985) is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives since the 2019 federal election, representing the Division of Ryan in Queensland. He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.

# Brisbane City Council 

Simmonds was elected to Brisbane City Council at a by-election in 2010, representing Walter Taylor Ward for the LNP. He was re-elected at the 2012 and 2016 local elections. Simmonds served as chair of the committees for public and active transport (2011–2012), finance, economic development and administration (2012–2016), and city planning (2016–2018). In his final speech to council in March 2019 he recalled there were "not many jobs that would give a 26-year-old the chance to help manage a $3 billion dollar budget". He resigned as a councillor about April 2019 to contest the 2019 Australian federal election and his successor in Walter Taylor Ward was James Mackay chosen by the Liberal National Party.

# Member of Parliament 

In May 2018, Simmonds defeated the sitting LNP member Jane Prentice for preselection in the Division of Ryan. He won the vote by 256 votes to 103, in what The Courier-Mail described as "a bitter preselection battle". He retained Ryan for the LNP at the 2019 election with a small negative swing.
