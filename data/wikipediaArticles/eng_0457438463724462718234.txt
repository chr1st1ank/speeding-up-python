## Rick Kane

The Kane Chronicles is a trilogy of adventure and Egyptian mythological fiction books written by American author Rick Riordan. The series is set in the same universe as Riordan's other franchises, Camp Half-Blood Chronicles and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard.
The novels are narrated alternately in first-person by the two protagonists, siblings Carter and Sadie Kane. The siblings are powerful magicians descended from the two pharaohs Narmer and Ramses the Great. They and their friends are forced to contend with Egyptian gods and goddesses who still interact with the modern world.

# Origins 

Author Rick Riordan, a former middle-school social studies teacher, stated that the idea for The Kane Chronicles came from his realization that the only ancient history subject more popular than Ancient Greece was Ancient Egypt. Riordan had already written and published several books in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, which dealt with the interaction between Greek mythology and the modern world. The idea of having two multiracial siblings narrate the books also came from his experience as a teacher. Carter and Sadie Kane, the titular characters, were inspired by two siblings that he taught, as well as the fact that Ancient Egypt was a multicultural society. He adhered to the longstanding Western tradition of separating Egyptian history from the history of other African societies.

# Novel series 

Section entitled "Author's Notes" at the beginning and end of books in the series explain to readers that the story is a transcript of audiotapes Rick Riordan received from Carter and Sadie Kane. The story takes place in the same universe as the Camp Half-Blood chronicles and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard and several references are made to the other books. In the three main novels, only two characters - Drew Tanaka and Lacy - cross over between novel series.

# The Red Pyramid

The duo discover that they have been chosen as "hosts" by the gods Horus and Isis, respectively, and are hunted by the House of Life, the world's governing body of Egyptian magicians, as a result.

They journey across the world looking for clues to Ra's location (as well as the location of a missing magician named Zia Rashid), and finally into the Duat to rescue Ra and drive Apophis further from the mortal world.

# The Serpent's Shadow 

The third and last volume, The Serpent's Shadow, was released on May 1, 2012.A few months after the events of the previous book, the House of Life is battling repeated invasions by the forces of chaos, leading the Kanes and their trainees to look desperately for a way to stop Apophis.
