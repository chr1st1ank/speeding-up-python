# MarketWatch resignation and SEC investigation 

In January 2004, Calandra resigned from MarketWatch and was subject to an informal regulatory inquiry. On January 10, 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against him in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case involved civil fraud charges citing an illegal trading scheme, a "buy-write-sell" pattern involving 23 different stocks, and was also settled at the time of filing. Calandra paid US$416,109.58 in disgorgement of illegal trading profits and a civil penalty of US$125,000. Calandra's settlement with the SEC did not include an admission or denial of the allegations and agreed to a "permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws". In a 2011 interview with Karen Roche of The Gold Report, Calandra apologized for his actions stating it was "no excuse for a trained journalist" and " I acknowledge my errors from back then".
