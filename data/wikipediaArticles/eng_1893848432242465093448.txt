His return from injury came just in time for him to make his test debut for the Kiwis for the ANZAC day test at the SCG. He started the game at hooker and had a solid debut. Luke was named at halfback for the round 8 clash against the North Queensland Cowboys to accommodate both himself and fellow hooker George Ndaira in the starting side.
