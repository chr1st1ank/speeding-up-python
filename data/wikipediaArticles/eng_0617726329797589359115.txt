## January 2013 Southeastern United States floods

The January 2013 Southeastern United States floods occurred from January 14 to 17, and resulted in mudslides and washouts throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains region. At the height of the flooding, 50 roads were declared impassable in Greene County, Tennessee alone. A similar storm system brought more flooding rain to the region from January 27 to 31.

# Closure of U.S. Route 441 

As a result of the heavy rainfall, a January 16 landslide claimed a 200-feet section of U.S. Route 441 (known locally as "Newfound Gap Road") in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina. The road, which crosses Newfound Gap at the Tennessee state line, was closed until April 15.
