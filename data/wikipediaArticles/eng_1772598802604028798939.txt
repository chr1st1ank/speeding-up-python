## Russell (Manitoba electoral district)

Russell was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was located in the southwestern section of the province.

# Historical riding 

The original Russell riding was created in 1886, shortly after the expansion of Manitoba's western boundaries. It existed until 1957, when it was combined with the riding of Birtle as Birtle-Russell. The riding was primarily agrarian, and elected candidates from various parties who supported agrarian interests.

# Modern riding 

The riding of Birtle-Russell lasted from 1957 to 1979, and the subsequent riding of Roblin-Russell from 1979 to 1999. In 1999, the Roblin section of the riding was joined with Dauphin as Dauphin—Roblin, and a separate Russell riding was re-established. The riding was dissolved again in 2011.
The modern riding was bordered to the north by Dauphin—Roblin, to the east by Ste. Rose, to the south by Minnedosa and Arthur-Virden, and to the west by the province of Saskatchewan. The town of Russell was the main urban centre in this riding, which also included Birtle, Inglis, Angusville, Rossburn, Erickson, Oakburn, Shoal Lake and Hamiota. The Riding Mountain National Park and Asessippi Provincial Park were also located in Russell.
The riding's population in 1996 was 18,647. In 1999, the average family income was $39,999, and the unemployment rate was 6.10%. Russell remained primarily an agrarian riding, with agriculture accounting for 32% of its industry. Fourteen per cent of the riding's residents were aboriginal, and a further 13% were Ukrainian. The riding also had the second-highest percentage of senior citizens in Manitoba, at 21% of the total.
The last MLA was Len Derkach of the Progressive Conservative Party, who held the riding of Roblin-Russell from 1986 to 1999. The New Democratic Party made serious inroads in the riding before its dissolution.
Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was renamed Riding Mountain and expanded to include parts of the riding of Minnedosa. This change took effect for the 2011 election.
