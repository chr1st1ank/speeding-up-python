## Kanagawa 8th district

Kanagawa 8th district (Kanagawa 8-ku, 神奈川8区) or more formally the "8th district of Kanagawa Prefecture" (Kanagawa-ken dai-8-ku, 神奈川県第8区) is a single-member electoral district for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the National Diet of Japan. It is located in the Northeast of the prefecture (-ken) of Kanagawa and consists of two wards (-ku) of the prefectural capital, the city (-shi) of Yokohama: Midori and Aoba. As of 2013, 385,415 eligible voters were registered in the district.Before the 2002 redistricting, i.e. until the 2003 general House of Representatives election, the 8th district consisted of Aoba-ku and the Miyamae-ku of Kawasaki-shi, the second major city in Kanagawa-ken. Midori had previously been part of the 7th district, Miyamae was transferred to the newly created 18th district.
After the introduction of single-member districts with the electoral reform of 1994, effective in the 1996 Representatives election, the district was initially won by pre-reform 1st district incumbent Hiroshi Nakada (New Frontier Party→Independents (political party)) who resigned for his (successful) campaign in the 2002 mayoral election in Yokohama city and later returned to the House of Representatives, but this time from Hokuriku-Shin'etsu. The resulting special election in Kanagawa 8th district was won by independent Kenji Eda. Eda lost the district in the 2003 Representatives election to Democrat Tetsundo Iwakuni, but won it back in 2005 and has held onto the seat since.
