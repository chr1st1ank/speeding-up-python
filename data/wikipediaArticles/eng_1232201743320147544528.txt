James Dens Maia da Silva (born 14 August 1986 in Curitiba) is a Brazilian football agent and former defender who last played for Rio Branco Sport Club.

# Club career 

James passed through the youth systems of his hometown clubs Paraná Clube and Coritiba, starting his professional career at the latter. In 2007, he joined Villa Nova, only to return to the Serié A by signing for Juventude later in the year, breaking into the first team and making 9 appearances. He spent 2008 in the Serié C club J. Malucelli, before moving to Europe, signing a four-year deal with Slavia Prague in February 2009. He struggled to make the first team during his year and a half there, and only made four competitive appearances throughout his time at the club. His contract was terminated in July 2010, and he returned to the lowly Aparecida Futebol Clube, but stayed there only two weeks before being recalled to Europe and signing for the Croatian side NK Zagreb. There he was a constant starter and had a good season, but refused to sign an extension of his contract, moving, in the summer of 2011, to division giants Hajduk Split on a free transfer.
After stints in Croatia and Cyprus, he returned home to Brazil, to play for Rio Branco Sport Club. After several matches for the club, plagued by an injured knee, he had to undertake surgery, but was unable to return to professional football afterwards, retiring officially in July 2015. Afterwards, he started working as an agent.
