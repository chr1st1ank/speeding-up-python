## Liberdade (neighbourhood)

Liberdade is the second most populous district of Salvador, (exceeded only by Cajazeiras). Salvador is the Capital City of the Brazilian State of Bahia. 

# Features 

Located on top of the plateau that divides the Lower City ("Cidade Baixa"), where there is a quay and ports, from the higher city ("Cidade Alta"), Liberdade is densely populated with, in general, low income residents and has a strong community life within itself, making it feel like a large "city" within the Metropolis.
The neighbourhood is thought to have the highest population of Afro-Brazilian residents in Bahia, which is the most Afro-Brazilian state in Brazil. It is thus often said to be the neighbourhood with the most black people in Brazil.
It is a very lively neighborhood, where there are always parties. Liberdade also sits on an incline. The Cultural Association Ilê Aiyê is also based in Liberdade. Ilê Aiyê is a carnival block celebrating its African roots that cultivates and performs social work that seeks to improve the self-esteem of black people through affirmative action. 
Close to Liberdade is the "Educational Center Carneiro Ribeiro"', arguably one of the largest and most pioneering educational initiative in Brazil, created by educator baiano Anisio Teixeira and better known as College Park - it came later to inspire the creation of CIEPs and CIACs.

# History 

During the colonial era, there was Boiadas of the road - a road that joined the Capital sertões happening and where the cattle, largely bred in the interior - were marketed and exported through the port of Salvador. 
When the Brazilians won the war of independence against the Portuguese in Bahia, the victorious troops who had liberated Brazilian from the colonial yoke of Portuguese rule march through what is now Liberdade and the old road was renamed 'Liberdade' meaning freedom - a feeling, the greatest day in the history of Bahia, the name of this district that, above all, breathe Liberdade.
