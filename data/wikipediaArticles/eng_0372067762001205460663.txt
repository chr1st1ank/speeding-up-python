# Premise 

The show follows a group of teens stranded on a South Pacific island in the Federated States of Micronesia after they crash their plane (a De Havilland Heron) in a tropical storm while flying to an eco-adventure camping trip in Palau. A plot device of a video diary powered by a solar battery charger allows the kids to talk about themselves and to the camera about their difficult everyday struggles, the island, and each other. It plays out as "Lost " for teens, though without any of the supernatural aspects of Lost. It also has many similarities with The New People and with Gordon Korman's trilogy Island".

# Characters 

# Main characters 

# Lex Marin 

The youngest of the group and Daley's younger 10-year-old (turns 11) stepbrother who is intelligent, charismatic, and very observant, although the group constantly ignores him or put his ideas down, stating that "he's not old enough". He always comes up with the best ideas on how to adapt to the island and make use of its resources. He seems to be the motivation of the group. Whenever everyone else feels like quitting or giving up, Lex comes up with a brilliant idea to help everyone feel better. In the episode "Mazeathon", he creates an obstacle course. For Chilloween, he makes a shower that has warm water to make the island more like home. He has even made a shelter that lasted through many violent storms. As shown in several episodes, he misses the others from the plane and wants Abby to find them.
In Hotel Tango, Lex surprises everyone by saying it was Daley's fault the group separated and does not want to listen to her anymore.

# Nathan McHugh 

In the first season Nathan brags about being a Boy Scout and thinks he should be the leader. He is very close friends with Melissa and later on in the series develops a crush on Daley. Throughout a few seasons Nathan begins to think he is useless and no help to the others on the island. For example, he accidentally shoots down the signal kite when he is messing around with Lex and he also falls out of a tree trying to get coconuts. He was portrayed as snobby in the novel, and wore rich people clothes, Slip-on sneakers, converse low-tops, slip-on converse, and canvas Boat shoes is what he wears throughout the books, also he wore water shoes for when going in the water and getting to the raft.

# Daley Marin 

She's the recently elected class president of Hartwell High School, who beat Nathan by 10 votes. She's a hard worker and a bit of a perfectionist. Daley is Lex's stepsister (her father married Lex's mother about a year ago after her mother died), though this is never elaborated upon. Daley has developed a mutual crush on Nathan. Before which they would always fight. She, however, is much more secretive about this, confiding about it only to Melissa. Daley even kisses Nathan on the cheek once because he saves her from drowning. Daley finally tells Nathan she likes him. She wants to begin a relationship with him on the island. They do, however, they agree to become a couple once everyone's off the island and back home safe again. Daley became the leader of the group ( only after Jackson turned over the responsibility to her ) and wants to handle situations in a civilized manner. The members don't always approve of her ways though. She's too bossy, yells and wants things her way over the others. She's fond of democracy and resolving matters through voting. This ultimately causes a divide in the group. Eric, Jackson and Melissa go to explore the west side of the island with Abby. Meanwhile, Nathan, Taylor, Lex and democratic Daley stay at the camp. In the novel she's street smart and very strong minded. She wears street clothes including Converse low-tops. She cheated in the elections and paid all 10 voters to vote for her.

# Eric McGorrill 

He is more of a slacker and a comedian than anything else. He also tends to manipulate people to get out of various responsibilities and chores. Eric looks at other people's video diaries and announces their secrets to either one person or everyone. He hates lugging water, and caused the lighter to break leaving the group with no source of fire. However, he later fixes it. He wants to get off the island so he sneaks around taking miscellaneous objects. His actions are eventually discovered by Lex who informs Melissa. Due to allergies he wasn't aware of, he becomes extremely ill after eating shellfish. Nearly dying from an allergic reaction until Melissa gives him a shot which saves him. In the novel he's described as a class clown and acts like "the millionaire" from Gilligan's Island. He wears nice clothes, boat shoes, sperry top-siders and wears a straw fedora.

# Cody Jackson 

Cody goes by his last name, Jackson and he's the antihero of the series. Cody is a 16-year-old male who generally keeps to himself. At school he was befriended by Melissa, who extended him the invitation to join the eco-camping trip. On the island, Cody gives help to the group when it's needed. In the first episode he befriends Lex, and Cody unlike everyone else actually listens to him. As a result, he's elected the leader of the stranded kids (a position which he reluctantly accepts) and maintains to keep the group civil. In the second season due to all the drama, he passed the responsibility of leadership to Daley. It's in this season that a love triangle develops between him, Melissa and Taylor. It began when he grew closer to a matured Taylor. Things changed however in the final moments of the series. It becomes apparent that he wants to get to know Melissa even more- in a sense 'chose' her. This whole time he's only gone by the name Jackson until the Flight 29 Down film; before they get saved, Melissa asks Jackson if Jackson was his first or last name. He replies, "It's Cody, Cody Jackson". He and Melissa become really close, and it's implied they will become romantically involved in the future.

# Taylor Hagan 

Taylor comes onto the island thinking that being stranded was only temporary. Her life of being pampered and spoiled made her weaker than the others. However, soon she starts show some of her hidden talents. For example, she helps Jackson improve his fishing skills through small notes, then on one particular trek through the island, she discovers a trove of fruit and even gets the fire started when they're in need of it. She believes everyone in the group has a function, something that they're good at. It's because of this she comes to the realization that she's good at parties and having fun. She creates the holiday, Chilloween, which was featured in one of the episodes. In the first season, she proves that she hates being messed with and will go to great lengths to get revenge (revealing Melissa's video diary). A recurring problem in the second season is the relationship she and Jackson develop, much to the dismay of Melissa. By the end of the series, people recognize her as a more competent and genuine person. Throughout the series she becomes hard working and more aware of the others' feelings.

# Melissa Wu 

Melissa has been best friends with Nathan since kindergarten. She's one of the only level-headed ones on the island. However, tends to have an occasional habit of being overly hard on herself. She has a crush on Jackson, which Taylor reveals to everyone after Melissa accidentally ruins one of her shirts. She often tries to be everyone's friend, which causes her to lie in one episode. Melissa had a secret crush on Jackson when she wanted to be with him on the way back to school to talk to her friend. She tells her that she likes Jackson. At first Melissa doesn't like Abby, but in time her feelings change and they become friends. There's even a storm named after her called Typhoon Melissa. In Season Two she becomes distraught when Jackson and a matured Taylor grow closer. This problem is temporarily resolved as Taylor does not go west with Abby although Melissa, Jackson and Eric go. Melissa, Jackson, Eric, and Abby are on the same groups since 1st season of Flight 29 Down.
