However in 1880 the House ruled that the committee had additional jurisdiction of all subjects relating to territorial legislation, the revision of legislation in territories, or the admission of states.Over its lifetime the committee reported legislation that affected the structure, status or power of the territorial governments, statehood, the power of municipalities, and boundary disputes. Additionally on public land in territories they had authority over railroads, public works and buildings, highways, taxes, bond issuing, education, Indian control, prohibition and wildlife.Petitions of the 62d through 79th Congresses (1911-46) relate almost exclusively to Alaska and Hawaii.
